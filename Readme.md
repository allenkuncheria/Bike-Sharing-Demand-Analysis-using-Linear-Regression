# Title
Bike Sharing Demand Analysis using Linear Regression

# Description
A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, was looking to understand demand for shared bikes after the COVID-19 lockdown in order to stand out from competitors and make huge profits.

The goal of the project was to
- model demand with the available independent variables,
- identify the variables that were significant in predicting demand, and
- determine how well the variables describe bike demand.

BoomBikes intended to modify its business strategy to meet demand levels and achieve outstanding performance.

# Approach to Analysis
Analysis was done as per the following steps:
- Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Data Visualisation
- Data Preparation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Interpretation

# Results
The modelling process yielded a multiple linear regression model with 13 explanatory variables having an R2 score of 0.844 on the training set and 0.8131 on the test set. The linear equation was constructed using the code outpute and the impact of the various variables was described.
