# Title
Bike Sharing Demand Analysis using Linear Regression

# Description
A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, is looking to understand demand for shared bikes after the COVID-19 lockdown in order to stand out from competitors and make huge profits.

The goal of the project is to
- model demand with the available independent variables,
- identify the variables that are significant in predicting demand, and
- determine how well the variables describe bike demand.

BoomBikes intends to modify its business strategy to meet demand levels and achieve outstanding performance.

# Approach to Analysis
Analysis is done as per the following steps:
- Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Data Visualisation
- Data Preparation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Interpretation

# Results
The best multiple linear regression model has 13 explanatory variables, and R^2 scores of 0.844 on the training set and 0.8131 on the test set. The linear equation constructed using the estimated coefficients correctly describes the impact of the various variables.
